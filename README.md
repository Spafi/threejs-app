# 3D Scene Application

This application demonstrates a simple 3D scene using Three.js, Inversify, and TypeScript.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `src/app`: Main application files
- `src/app/components`: Components (objects) used in the application
- `src/app/core`: Core functionalities, including scene-related classes and services
- `src/app/services`: Application services
- `src/environments`: Environment configurations for development and production builds

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and yarn installed on your system

### Installation

1. Install the dependencies: `yarn intstall`
2. Run `dev-parcel`

## Implementation

To customize the application, you can add new components or modify existing ones in the `src/app/components` directory. Update the scene and camera settings in the `src/app/core` directory, and manage application-wide services in the `src/app/services` directory.

Use Inversify for dependency injection and update the `inversify.config.ts` file as needed.
